## Introduction

This project was completed as part of Luke Barousse’s Excel for Data Analytics course. It focused on foundational Excel skills including formulas, functions, data validation, and basic charting.

Using a provided dataset of data-related job listings, I followed the course exercises step-by-step, completing the analysis to explore salary patterns, job titles, locations, and key skills. This project helped me build a solid base in Excel before moving on to more advanced techniques in the next project.

### 🧮 Formulas and Functions

#### 💰 Median Salary by Job Titles

```
=MEDIAN(
IF(
    (jobs[job_title_short]=A2)*

    (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(type,jobs[job_schedule_type])))*
    (jobs[salary_year_avg]<>0),
    jobs[salary_year_avg]
)
)
```

- 🔍 **Multi-Criteria Filtering:** Checks job title, country, schedule type, and excludes blank salaries.
- 📊 **Array Formula:** Utilizes `MEDIAN()` function with nested `IF()` statement to analyze an array.
- 🎯 **Tailored Insights:** Provides specific salary information for job titles, regions, and schedule types.

    - 🎯 User input is restricted to predefined, validated schedule types
    - 🚫 Incorrect or inconsistent entries are prevented
    - 👥 Overall usability of the dashboard is enhanced
