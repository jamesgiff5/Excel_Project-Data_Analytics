# My Excel Data Analytics Projects
This repository showcases two Excel projects I completed as part of my journey into data analytics. Each project focuses on different Excel skills, including formulas and functions, data validation, charts, PivotTables, Power Query, and DAX. These projects were built following the [Excel for Data Analytics course by Luke Barousse](https://lukebarousse.com/), and demonstrate key capabilities useful for data analyst roles.


## Salary Dashboard
This dashboard helps people explore salaries for different data jobs so they can see if they're being fairly paid. Itâ€™s built with basic Excel tools like formulas, data validation, and charts to make the data easy to understand.

I wanted to break down what skills and roles lead to higher pay in data jobs. This dashboard helps visualize the trends so it's easier to figure out where to focus if you're looking to grow your career.
